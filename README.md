# What is this website?

## I am studying web development with The Odin Project. 

Now, i am studying flexbox, a css resource that alows you to create
beautiful responsive web pages with some ease that "float" placement
doesn't provide.

Feel free to take a simp of the css. As you can see, it has diverse flex-box concepts!

That's all for now.
